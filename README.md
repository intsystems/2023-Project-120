## Abstract


This paper is developed to introduce a new method of creating ensembles of deep learning models. 
Many modern researches were focused on creating effective and efficient algorithms of differentiable architecture search,
missing oppotunity to create ensembles of less sophisticated deep learning models. This approach gives impressive results
as it was shown in few modern papers. In our research we investigate an algorithm of sampling deep learning models using
hypernetwork, which controls diversity of the models. Distinction between two models is measured in terms of Jensenâ€“Shannon
divergence which keeps the algorythm differentiable. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conducted
experiments on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and compare the resulting ensembles with ones sampled by other
searching algorithms.

## Run experimnet


To run basic code go to folder code and open demo.ipynb.
All packages are available through simple installation:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Demonstration includes:

- Search of the optimal architecture
- Search for the range of hyperparameters
- Diversity investigation
- Retrain of the gained architectures
- Validation of the ensemble

## Deep ensemble

Architectural space can be viwed as a continious space where architectures differ in terms of edges. The further architecture is from the optimal one, the worse it preforms.

Our method aims to find a solution to sample architectures to be included into ensemble in one shoot under assumptions introduced by the picture above.
